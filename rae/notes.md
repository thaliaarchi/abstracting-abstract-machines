# Type directed compilation of row-typed algebraic effects

Algebraic effects subsume specialized control flow concepts, such as exceptions,
state, iterators, and async-await.

What are row types?

What are free monads?

A `handler` in Koka is an instance of an operation interface, with `return` and
`raise` defined. It resembles monad instances with `bind` and `return`.

## Topic 1

How would effect types interact with laziness? If values cannot have effects,
then lazy evaluation could not produce exceptions.

It states it in the context of Koka, but assume it in a wider sense.

## Topic 2

How do algebraic effects compare to typeclasses? Algebraic effects seem like
typeclasses with dynamic, lexically-scoped instance resolution.
