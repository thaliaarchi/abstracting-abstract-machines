# Type directed compilation of row-typed algebraic effects

Algebraic effects subsume specialized control flow concepts, such as exceptions,
state, iterators, and async-await.

What are row types?

What are free monads?

A `handler` in Koka is an instance of an operation interface, with `return` and
`raise` defined. It resembles monad instances with `bind` and `return`.

## Topic 1

How would effect types interact with laziness? If values cannot have effects,
then lazy evaluation could not produce exceptions.

It states it in the context of Koka, but assume it in a wider sense.

## Topic 2

How do algebraic effects compare to typeclasses? Algebraic effects seem like
typeclasses with dynamic, lexically-scoped instance resolution.

Effect handlers allow for multiple resumptions and storing resumptions. It uses
delimited continuations.

Algebraic effects are dynamically resolved, wrt the effect user, and lexically
scoped, wrt the caller.

## Discussion

Relevant types would be useful to require that `resume`, the delimited
continuation, must be called at least once.

The Koka compiler only uses continuations for handlers that can be resumed more
than once. Usually, it uses implicit function pointers, that are thread-local.

### E

Could algebraic effects supersume all algebraic data types? Yes. This is the
data-codata duality.

Co-currying: can partially apply a handler.

Sum types are represented multiple by functions in the handler. Product types
are represented by multiple parameters to a function.

With continuations, you can express any monad.
